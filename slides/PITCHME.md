## Typescript

&rarr; statically typed language </br> 
&rarr; compiles to plain javascript </br> 
&rarr; popular js framework <b>Angular 2.0</b> </br> 

+++

## Problems of Javascript

&rarr; JS first developed as a language for client-side </br>
&rarr; Node.js marked JS as an emerging server-side technology </br>  
&rarr; JS difficult to maintain and not reusable</br> 
&rarr; no Object Orientation, no strong type checks, no compiling checks </br> 

+++

## Solution = Typescript

&rarr; designed by Andrers Hejlsberg (Designer of C# at Microsoft) </br> 
&rarr; strongly typed, object orientated and compiled language </br> 
&rarr; Typescript is a superset of Javascript </br> 
&rarr; will be compiled to Javascript </br> 

+++
Typescript is Javascript plus some additional features </br>
